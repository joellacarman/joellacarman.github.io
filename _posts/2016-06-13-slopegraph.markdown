I concepted and designed this piece for social media promoting the 2016 Social Progress Index.

The Social Progress Index does not include economic measures, so can be compared independently to GDP with interesting results: countries at similar levels of GDP do not have similar levels of social progress.

SPI uses scatterplots relentlessly to illustrate this concept, the slopegraph is a welcome alternate view of the same idea.
