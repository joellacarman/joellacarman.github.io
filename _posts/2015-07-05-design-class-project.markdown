[![LiquidLab project](/assets/different.png)](/assets/finalproject.pdf)


Just realized that I never added the final version of the fictitious juice company website I created for a graphic design class this spring. I never did find just the right pic online, so I'm leading with what might be the world's first arm-only selfie (feat. beets!) to hold the place of a real photo.

What did I learn from this exercise? It's hard to deal with all the content your "client" (or school project prompt) suggests you add in. The idea of this fake company is that they get people to subscribe to their custom juicing plans. The description in the prompt felt a bit confused on that tip - do busy people obsessed with their health want to read about farming practices, or receive so much hand holding before filling out the lifestyle choices/diet questionaire? Don't they just want to speed ahead to the acai berries?

I've always found class projects challenging. Making up the rationale behind these imaginary people stretches your creative brain in the opposite way you need it to go for a real workplace scenario. In reality, the last thing you want to do is fill in a lot of blanks about what a customer wants. Truth is stranger than fiction, so you'd better try to figure out what it is.
