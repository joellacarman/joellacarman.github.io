Just realized that I never added the final version of the fictitious juice company website I created for a graphic design class this spring. I never did find just the right pic online, so I'm leading with what might be the world's first arm-only selfie (feat. beets!).

What did I learn from this exercise? It's hard to deal with all the content your "client" (or school project prompt) suggests you add in. The idea of this fake company is that they get people to subscribe to their custom juicing plans, saving them time and improving their diet. But the description in the prompt felt a bit confused on that tip - lots of information about about farming practices, serious hand holding prior to seeing the actual lifestyle survey... Don't these busy people want to cut through all that crap and start chugging acai berries already? 

During the in-class review by local DC design professionals, I was repeatedly reminded that too much text is a bad thing. I wished I would have stuck with my instinct to simplify the content and come up with a more elegant site that felt right for the purpose. I've always found class projects challenging. Making up the rationale behind these imaginary people stretches your creative brain in the opposite way you need it to go for a real workplace scenario. In reality, the last thing you want to do is fill in a lot of blanks about what a customer wants. But in this case, since there was no real customer, I would have been better off accepting the prompt as a safe space for experimenting. After all, when facing real clients who don't go along with every suggestion, it's probably good to have the confidence that comes from having experiences where your instincts turned out to be right.
