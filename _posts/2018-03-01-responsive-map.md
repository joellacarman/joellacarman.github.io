This unpublished project was meant to be a simple view of stats for cities that share a similar [Fiscal Policy Space](http://fiscalpolicyspace.greatcities.uic.edu/). I think the reason for its failure lies in a lack of user research (surprise!). The creators and their main audience never solidified the notion of what it means to be a "peer city" through this novel set of statistical measures. Therefore, no one was happy with the piece - except me, because this marks the first time I created a fully responsive map inside an iframe. H/t the great crew at NPR Visuals, I riffed on (stole) your table styles.
