I worked on all aspects of this brochure. I wrote the copy, I designed the layout, and, most importantly, I talked with the key stakeholders over and over to understand what they wanted to highlight and who they were trying to reach.

Creating the key piece of marketing material for an organization is never easy. When I started at NLC in 2017, this redesign had already lingered on the shelf for months. It took many more months to learn how the organization sees itself, what its members see, or might see in it, and condense that into a vibrant bifold. But the effort paid off. This brochure is still useful three years later.


The success of this project9 came from listening to people and attending their meetings as much as the design or writing.
