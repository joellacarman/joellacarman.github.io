A Social Progress Index for the administrative regions of Rio de Janeiro was completed just months before the summer Olympics took place there in 2016. Seizing on this opportunity to promote SPI's work, our director flew to Rio and presented the index to journalists sent to Rio to cover the city surrounding the games. I created this map to be handed out to reporters at the event.
