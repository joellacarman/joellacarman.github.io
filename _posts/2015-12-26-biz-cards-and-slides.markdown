A few projects from late 2015:

![Biz card]({{ site.url }}/assets/bizcards.jpg)

I designed new business cards for the Social Progress Imperative. This organization has employees in many different countries, so we elected to leave off a location and make the website our home.

I created slides for our director's second [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_how_we_can_make_the_world_a_better_place_by_2030?language=en) given in London last September at TED Global. The scatterplot is a perennial at SPI, since our mission is to advance this index as a measure of things left out of GDP, notably the things that actually make life better. The fact that some countries are so far over or under the curve demonstrates that GDP doesn't automatically convert to what we describe as "social progress", as measured by "indicators" like "water and sanitation", "access to basic knowledge", "nutrition and basic medical care", "personal rights", etc for a whole society.

I focused on making these legible from far away in a dark room: dark background, strong contrast, minimal markings on the charts. Reportedly (via Michael Green) these received compliments from the TED Global people!
