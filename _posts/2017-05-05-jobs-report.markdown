Jobs in local government are the largest sector of government employment. The National League of Cities keeps track of the ups and downs in employment, issuing a monthly chart of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The original NLC chart was a high touch monthly assignment. I redesigned the project with the goal automating the work and supplying additional views to the data.
