**Role**: cover design, report layout

This cover was a challenge. The main concepts of the report are invisible but hugely consequential to daily life (basically the Internet and all the apps and connected sensors and devices it enables).

Straight photography is important to the branding of projects like these, so rather than illustrate these abstract concepts I highlighted parts of an everyday view that might belong in this "innovation economy" resulting in a quick and easy take on the main idea.
