The National League of Cities puts out many reports each year, _on paper_. I always enjoyed working on these layouts. Who wouldn't love being able to put the table of contents on an entryway?

[Full report here](https://www.nlc.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/NLC_CitiesInnovationEconomy_pages%5B1%5D.pdf)

This cover was a challenge. The main concepts of the report, the internet, apps, and connected sensors, are invisible but hugely consequential to daily life.

This concept, using color to highlight the parts of an everyday view that are part of the innovation economy, works pretty well, but now that I am older and wiser I wish the contrast was even stronger.
