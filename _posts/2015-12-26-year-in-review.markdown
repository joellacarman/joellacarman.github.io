Here are a few notable projects from my year. Notable, at least, to me.

This is the [first interactive](http://www.renewoureconomy.org/voterinteractive/) I worked on as an actual professional being paid cash money. I was the main developer on the project, with a lot of guidance from my excellent colleague, Reed Spool, for which I will always be grateful.

I got a lot better at d3 and JavaScript after this project!

Later in the year I started working at the Social Progress Imperative. My title here is "graphic designer", so I made myself a business card:

(And I made new ones for everyone else at the company.)


Perhaps even more exciting than the business cards, I created slides for our director's second [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_how_we_can_make_the_world_a_better_place_by_2030?language=en) given in London last September at TED Global. The scatterplot is a perennial at SPI, since our mission is to advance this index as a measure of things left out of GDP, notably the things that actually make life better. The fact that some countries are so far over or under the curve demonstrates that GDP doesn't automatically convert to what we describe as "social progress", as measured by "indicators" like "water and sanitation", "access to basic knowledge", "nutrition and basic medical care", "personal rights", etc for a whole society.

I focused on making these legible from far away in a dark room: dark background, strong contrast, minimal markings on the charts. Reportedly (via Michael Green) these received compliments from the TED Global people!

Then I got married and went absolutely nuts creating the main image for our wedding website (excerpted here). This strange obsession taught me a lot about Illustrator and the importance of having some kind of color palette.

I also did a few other things for my job, like an [interactive scatterplot](http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress), layout for print products, HTML emails (gasp!) and these little quickie ads for Twitter (design and copy):

Finally, InDesign accomplishment of the year: figuring out how to run Arabic text (right-to-left) in the same line with English numbers (left-to-right) for these translated versions of the [People's Report Card](https://twitter.com/socprogress/status/680359982076944384), a collaborative project with Global Citizen.

Also during my stint at Graphicacy, I worked on their annual Death & Taxes poster, a visualization of the federal budget. It's a lot of circles. Reed and I began work on a project to create the poster in JavaScript instead of R, reasoning that a web browser is a good place for graphics, and we could get closer to the final (bringing in images, for example) before pulling everything into Illustrator with SVG Crowbar for the actual print poster. 

We made a pretty sweet circle generator that pumped out one branch of goverment at a time in a ring of circles. We also created some fun layout tools that would allow a designer to adjust the radius of the outer ring and spacing among subdepartments on it before exporting into the layout. It's a bit hard to explain, better to show, but the project isn't online. I did learn that trigonometry is kind of fascinating (if you've forgotten how it works, read about the ["unit circle"](https://processing.org/tutorials/trig/) - triangles control the circle!). The math makes a lot more sense when you're using it to actually accomplish something than it did when you were a pimply pre-teen just freaking out that Mr. Bergzolf would catch you chewing gum or give you a D. SOH-CAH-TOA!

Since I don't have the work to show for that, here's a [blog post](http://graphicacy.com/can-raw-data-be-cooked/) I wrote about my best guess for explaining negative numbers in the federal budget. I was particularly proud of my little bar graph. What great colors! I think it really has the look of money.
