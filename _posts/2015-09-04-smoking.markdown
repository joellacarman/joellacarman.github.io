[![Does smoking cause social progress?](/assets/spi-smoking.png)](http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress)

A few months ago I started working at a non-profit that promotes national welfare index. Needless to say, this organization deals with a great deal of data, and part of my job is to think of presentations of it. I produced an interactive scatterplot of smoking rates (for men and women separately) vs. social progress as some blog fodder during a slow August. 

Smoking has nothing to do with health performance, it turns out, but there is an interesting observation to be had about nations with higher female smoking rates. Read [my post](http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress) to find out more.
