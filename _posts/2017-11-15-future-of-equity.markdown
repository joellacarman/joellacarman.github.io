I contributed two graphics to NLC's [The Future of Equity in Cities](http://www.nlc.org/article/urban-growth-trends-and-rise-of-tech-in-cities-point-to-widening-disparities), with design direction and layout by my colleague Soren Messner-Zidell. For both of these graphics I successfully pitched something different than what was originally planned, and consequently did the research and caption writing on top of design. In some ways it was a nice throw back to my days in the NPR library, but this time I got to tie the final bow on the work, too.
