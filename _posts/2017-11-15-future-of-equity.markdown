**Role**: design, research, copywriting

I contributed two graphics to this year's [City of the Future]() report, with design direction and layout by my colleague Soren Messner-Zidell. For both of these graphics I successfully pitched something different than what was originally planned, and consequently did the research and caption writing on top of design. In some ways it was a nice throw back to my days in the NPR library, but this time I got to tie the final bow on the work, too.
