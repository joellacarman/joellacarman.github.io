This look at the generational spread of the Democratic field was inspired by Pete Buttigieg's comment that his own youthful face was "the message" of his campaign. He told Morning Joe: "That's why I often talk about how the world's going to look in 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president. It's to remind us that this isn't just about one election." So what year will it be (or was it) when other candidates are 72, like Trump?

Most of the charts I make at CNN use templates. It's a sane way to handle daily graphics flow for many reasons, but one does enjoy a chance to get creative especially on a somewhat evergreen topic of candidate age.

I spent a few days workshopping this chart with colleagues. The first feature to stay were the gray columns for generational bands. This is something I've seen Pew Research center do a number of times and makes a lot of sense.

I also wanted to highlight the distance from age 72 for each candidate. It also creates a nice pattern. On mobile, however, I took this out since it's not original information (it's not hard to get that 37 is indeed a long way from 72).

Finally, I was persuaded to add photos. They do make a good detail element, sometimes.
