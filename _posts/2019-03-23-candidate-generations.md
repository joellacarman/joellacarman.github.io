This look at the generational spread of the Democratic field was inspired by Pete Buttigieg's comment that his own youthful face was "the message" of his campaign. He told Morning Joe: "That's why I often talk about how the world's going to look in 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president. It's to remind us that this isn't just about one election." 

So what year will it be (or was it) when other candidates are 72, like Trump?
