I've done a few basic heatmaps at work and wanted to take what I had learned and put it toward some "interesting" data. I thought it would be fun to do something with the 2012 Economic Census, so I put together [this piece](/projects/census/index.html) that displays either the "job births" or "job destructions" counted in each of our nation's 280+ lovely MSAs.

Most of my time so far has been spent on organizing the program to work efficiently. Since there are 8 survey years available (1977 to 2012), 280+ MSAs and something like 5 subcategories for each (depending on business size/age) preserving this dataset inside the program as something you can work with takes quite a bit of folding and unfolding. I found Shan Carter's [Mister Nester](http://bl.ocks.org/shancarter/raw/4748131/) to be an invaluable tool for wrapping my head around nesting functions in D3.

What I have at this point is a basic, functioning map. I'd like to one day take advantage of the data set better by setting up some filtering options. As mentioned, the data identifies companies by size and age. Since there's always so much chatter about the importance of small businesses being "job creators" I thought it would be interesting to see if any trends become evident on the map.

Making this map also made me think about how, in some ways, every heatmap/quantity map just becomes a map of the population. In this map, clearly New York and other large cities create and lose a ton of jobs. They also have a ton of people. I wonder whether adding a basic population heatmap as the base of the whole project would provide meaningful context.
