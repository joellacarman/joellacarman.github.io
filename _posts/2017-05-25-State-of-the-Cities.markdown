**Role**: design, copywriting

Presidents are not the only leaders to make an annual speech on progress and wellbeing; many mayors offer their assessments in a "state of the city" address, too. The National League of Cities analyzes these speeches and catalogs the topics foremost on the minds of local leaders.

My colleague Soren Messner-Zidell designed this report and I contributed graphics, including this one, repurposed for social media.
