**Role**: design, copywriting

Presidents are not the only leaders to make an annual speech on progress and wellbeing; many mayors give a "state of the city" address offering a local assessment, too. Each year the National League of Cities analyzes these speeches to learn which topics are foremost on the minds of local leaders. My colleague Soren Messner-Zidell designed this report, and I contributed graphics, including this repurposing for social media.
