I created the lead art for Kevin Liptak's story [Trump's G20 orbits around Xi, Putin, and other world leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-g20-meetings/index.html).

This piece follows an established style and I was able to turn it around in a few hours.
