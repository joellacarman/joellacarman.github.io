I created the lead art for Kevin Liptak's story [Trump's G20 orbits around Xi, Putin, and other world leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-g20-meetings/index.html).

I followed the establish style closely and turned the job around in about 2 hours. Had it been a more complicated idea I would have tried to come up with a few sketched concepts first.
