Melding three different photos with different lighting, exposures, etc., into a composite that looks natural can be a challenge. Even more so if you don't want to ground the silhouettes at the bottom of the frame.

Designers at CNN Politics often used organic-verging-on-angular lines at the bottom of the figures to solve this problem, as I did for this quick turn piece on Kevin Liptak's story [Trump's G20 orbits around Xi, Putin, and other world leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-g20-meetings/index.html).
