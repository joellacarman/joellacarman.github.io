It was an honor to work on the redesign of one of our team's biggest initiatives for the year.

The focus was on making each bit of voter logistics seamless and unambiguous. So instead of checks and x's, which can actually be hard to maintain for the researchers and, we found, somewhat ambiguous for readers, we used a conversational writing style to (hopefully) follow the line of thought one might have when forming the query.

The result is a simple page that thoughtfully provides critical information.

The project was promoted widely on the site, on television, and even in outdoor advertising. Some of the promotion was in-house. I crafted this background for automated Twitter graphics on short notice for automated graphics my colleague put together with Puppeteer, leveraging the type and color of the original piece. I think it came out nicely for something done in less than an hour!
