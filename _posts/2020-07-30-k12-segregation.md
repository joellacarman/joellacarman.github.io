It may seem obvious that a school is segregated when the student body is demographically homogeneous, but Urban's researchers point out the importance of considering a school's surrounding demographics, too. 

To show how this can be distilled into one number, our team created a scrollyteller that unpacks the index using a school that may not seem segregated at first, but, compared to the neighborhood it sits in, is actually quite segregated. 

Readers can also follow along in the explanatory section with a school of their own choosing, or find their school/school system in the lookup panel at the bottom. 

We really dug into the report and notes for this project and became quite adept at explaining how it works (even according to the researchers).

The illustration serves to highlight that the data in the charts is about real kids who are connected, in ways good and bad, by the choices we make about resources across a system. It also gives readers something to look at during the considerably long page load :)
