A wonderful man, Sean, my fiancee, got me a drawing tablet for my birthday last year. I'm ashamed to say it's taken me a while to get into using it. But scooting yourself into that creative groove you need for drawing can be a lot of work. Especially when you're trying to figure out new tools. Excuses! But really, I'm gonna use this thing more. I'm gonna improve the drawings on this site -- and maybe animate them.

Can't stop, won't stop!
