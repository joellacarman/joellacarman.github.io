For many months as the 2020 race ramped up at CNN we made do with a set of mismatched photos rather than true head shots. I wanted to do what I could to polish those photos and make our graphics better.

Converting to black and white is an old trick for bringing unity to a ragged set. Dialing up the contrast and pairing with a strong blue also strengthened the cohesiveness. This new set was more eye-catching and the graphics that used them turned out to have pretty good legs.

The Colbert Show used a [bar chart](/assets/LateShow.jpg) I made with the same set of heads on a July 2019 quarterly fund raising segment. The graphic above was included in an  [explainer](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/13/how-to-qualify-for-a-presidential-debate-mh-orig.cnn) on the debates for CNNâ€™s social channels.
