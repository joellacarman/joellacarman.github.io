At CNN, for many months as the race to 2020 ramped up we made do with a set of mismatched photos rather than true headshots and I wanted to do what I could to polish those photos.

Converting to black and white is an old trick for bringing unity to a ragged set. Dialing up the contrast and pairing the photos with a strong blue strengthened the cohesivenesss and made for an eye-catching graphic that turned out to have pretty good legs.

The Colbert Show used a [bar chart](/assets/LateShow.jpg) I made with the same set of heads on a July 2019 episode about quarterly fundraising reports, and this particular graphic was included in an  [explainer](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/13/how-to-qualify-for-a-presidential-debate-mh-orig.cnn) on the debates for CNNâ€™s social channels.
