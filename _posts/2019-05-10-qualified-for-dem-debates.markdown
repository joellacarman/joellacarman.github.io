In high school I enjoyed dabbling in the darkroom. It always gives me great pleasure to get Photoshop to deliver inky black tones, bright highlights and crisp detail that I never could with filters, timers and stop bath.

It was quite satisfying to take these mismatched "headshots" and give them that high contrast treatment, making a disparate set of images feel like they belonged together.

These high contrast faces appealed to the video team as well, I think: They included the image in their [explainer video](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/13/how-to-qualify-for-a-presidential-debate-mh-orig.cnn) about the qualifying process for the Democratic debates.

Later I learned that [The Late Show with Stephen Colbert used a graphic](/assets/LateShow.jpg) I made with the same set of headshots in a segment on second quarter fundraising!
