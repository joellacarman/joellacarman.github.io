In high school I enjoyed dabbling in the darkroom. It always gives me great pleasure to get Photoshop to deliver inky black tones, bright highlights and crisp detail that I never could with filters, timers and stop bath.

It was quite satisfying to take our mismatched "headshots" (I don't know that any of these were actually professional portraits) and make them feel like they belonged together.

These high contrast faces appealed to the video team as well, I think: They included the image in their [explainer video](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/13/how-to-qualify-for-a-presidential-debate-mh-orig.cnn) about the qualifying process for the Democratic debates.

This just in: [The Late Show with Stephen Colbert](https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/video/5q_UgY_7TMY_AbIaPj2tufW1spd_fL88/the-late-show-7-17-19-sofia-vergara-david-cross-tove-lo-/) used a [graphic](/assets/LateShow.jpg) I made with the same set of headshots in a segment on second quarter fundraising!
