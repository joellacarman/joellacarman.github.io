This quick turn feature highlights a new way to measure equity in transportation planning. 

The researchers on this project worked with a very small areas, census block groups. 

We wanted readers to easily be able to find their neighborhood on the map, which can be difficult with a geographic boundary like this one which folks don't really use in daily life. 

Zooming down to street level to see roads and landmarks is very handy for for orienting the reader without getting mired in technical definitions. Thanks to Mapbox, all of this functionality came built in.
