How do you show not just how far potential workers are from jobs, but how difficult (and likely) it is for them to get there?

This quick turn feature highlights a new way to measure equity in transportation planning that considers just that issue: access to jobs. 

Our challenge as the comms team was to make this complex measure easy to understand. A choropleth map is great for spatial data and worked well here to highlight the problem areas leaders should target with more funding. 

We also needed to make it easy for a reader to find a particular neighborhood on the map. The data is calculated by Census block group, not very intuitive for most people. Mapbox, with its built-in layer of roads and landmarks, was a great solution. Making that base layer visible through the data overlay required a lot of careful thought and experimentation with color, opacity, and layering. 

The end result is a beautiful, textured map that's easy to navigate and clearly identifies neighborhoods in need of additional transit.
