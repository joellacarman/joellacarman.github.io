![Liquid Lab Layout]({{ site.url }}/assets/liquidlab.png)

Liquid Lab saves your time, health and money. Or just the first two... maybe. Actually it does nothing. It's a fake company. I'm only crafting a layout for its website because I'm taking a course on graphic design, and this was the assignment.

I think this is a decent stab at doing a simple layout, but it's not that interesting. The center alignment is very safe, very quiet. Too quiet.

Originally I wanted a simple white background, a well lit photo of delicious juice and some very large, bold sans serif text taking charge over the image. I thought that might feel like "you're busy, you're hip, you're healthy - you want this juice". However, I don't get to commission a photo, and am going with what I find in the Creative Commons search (thanks and credit to Flickr user Stiftelsen Elektronikkbransjen for the photo!).

My idea now is that the vegetable pile is sort of like your chaotic life, and you're glad to have someone else deal with it, blending it down into a sweet-ish, no-chew-required, food paste ("juicing"). I was just working with some phrasing like "Liquid Lab deals with these guys", but I'm not entirely satisfied yet.

I'll be sure to let you know what I come up with.
