![Liquid Lab Layout]({{ site.url }}/assets/liquidlab.png)

Liquid Lab saves your time, health and money. Or just the first two... maybe. Actually it does nothing. It's a fake company. I'm only crafting a layout for its website because I'm taking a course on graphic design, and this was the assignment.

I think this is a decent stab at doing a simple layout, but it's not that interesting. And it looks more like a poster than a website.

Originally I wanted a simple white background, a well lit photo, bold sans serif text taking charge over the image. I thought that might feel like "you're busy, you're hip, you're healthy - you want this juice". However, I have yet to lay hands on such a photo- I'm going with what I find in the Creative Commons search (thanks and credit to Flickr user Stiftelsen Elektronikkbransjen for the photo!).

I would describe the sentiment behind this piece as: the vegetable pile is sort of like your chaotic life, and you're glad to have someone else deal with it, blending it down into a sweet-ish, no-chew-required, food paste ("juicing"). I was just working with some phrasing like "Liquid Lab deals with these guys", but I'm not entirely satisfied yet.

I'll be sure to let you know what I come up with.
