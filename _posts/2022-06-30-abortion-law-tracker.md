After the Dobbs decision, our team set out to track evolving abortion laws across the country and to provide the information in a way that would be useful to the readers.

I designed and built this simple presentation of the laws on a tight timeline. I am happy with how maintainable it has been, a key requirement for something like this is built to update.
