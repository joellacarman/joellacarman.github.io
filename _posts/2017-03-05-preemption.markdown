My new workplace, National League of Cities, advocates for municipal goverments in Washington. They also study issues that affect local government.

For this report I was asked to create a graphic of the 50 states showing seven policy areas where states commonly limit what individual cities can do. Click on the image for the report, *City Rights in an Era of Preemption: A State-by-State Analysis*.
