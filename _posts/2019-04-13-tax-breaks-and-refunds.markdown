This graphic ran with the story [Here's who's winning under Trump's tax law](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html). I started out by making bar chart so the individual states could be identified, but this buried the real takeaway: refunds shrank only in blue states.

I let go of individual state labels in favor of showing the red/blue grouping and it became a more concise and effective piece.

After the fact, I found out the name for ["beeswarm"](https://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320) charts and wish I could have used that layout here.
