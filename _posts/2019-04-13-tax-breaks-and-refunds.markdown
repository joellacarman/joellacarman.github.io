The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Law reduced many people's taxes, but thanks to reduced payroll deductions many did not see a larger refund for the year. This chart shows how that broke differently for residents of red and blue states.

In order to fit information about all 50 states in one view, I prioritized showing the red/blue pattern over individual state names.
