This graphic ran with the story [Here's who's winning under Trump's tax law](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html). I started out by making bar chart so the individual states could be identified. After looking more closely at the data, however, I saw the real takeaway from the chart should be this striking fact that refunds shrank only in blue states. I let go of individual state labels in favor of showing the red/blue grouping and it became a much more concise, effective piece!
