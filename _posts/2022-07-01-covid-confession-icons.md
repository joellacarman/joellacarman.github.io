Trying to work in someone else's style is a fun challenge and a great way to learn. I had this opportunity with "Covid Confessions", a reader callout the data graphics team published long before I joined. 

By 2022 the pandemic had changed enough that reader confessions didn't fit the old categories. We needed new icons and I was assigned the task. Is it easy to tell which ones are mine?

The fact that they are the last three may give it away, but these were my additions:
