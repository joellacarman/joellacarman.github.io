The team working on [this story](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/politics/inside-dhs-after-the-purge/index.html) was captivated by this photo of a ribbon-cutting ceremony showing a number of soon-to-be-replaced officials and acting or otherwise temporary leadership. I used cut lines and shading to highlight the individuals who were coming and going.

The figures outlined in dots remind me of paper dolls, which might be a good metaphor for a future illustration.
