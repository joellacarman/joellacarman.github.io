The team working on this story was captivated by this photo of a ribbon-cutting ceremony showing a number of soon-to-be-replaced officials and acting or otherwise temporary leadership. I used cut lines and shading to highlight the individuals who were coming and going.

The figures outlined in dots remind me of paper dolls, which might be a good metaphor for a future illustration.
