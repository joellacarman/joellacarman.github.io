The team working on [this story](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/politics/inside-dhs-after-the-purge/index.html) was captivated by this photo of a ribbon-cutting ceremony showing a number of soon-to-be-replaced officials and acting or otherwise temporary leadership. 

Direct notation is a handy (and cool) way to make it easy for a reader to see your point. Here it works well to note officials that are coming and going.
