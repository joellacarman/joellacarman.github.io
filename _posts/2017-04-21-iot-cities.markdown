My colleague Soren Messner-Zidell created this engaging illustration for NLC's report on [Smart City Development](http://www.nlc.org/resource/smart-city-development).

In the print report, the diagram is labeled with 20+ ways that sensors and data collection help city governments. To make it legible in a small space online, I proposed breaking the labels into topic sections.

This multi-step "guided tour" borrows from Jim Vallandingham's [stepper tutorial](http://vallandingham.me/stepper_steps.html).
