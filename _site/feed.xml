        <title>Fun With Correlation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/spi-smoking.png&quot; alt=&quot;Does smoking cause social progress?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I started working at a non-profit that promotes an index which is meant to go along GDP as an overall measure of nations’ performce. Needless to say, this organization deals with a great deal of data, and part of my job is to think of presentations of it. I produced an interactive scatterplot of smoking rates (for men and women separately) vs. social progress as some blog fodder during a slow August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking has nothing to do with health performance, it turns out, but there is an interesting observation to be had about nations with higher female smoking rates. Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress&quot;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Class Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/finalproject.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/different.png&quot; alt=&quot;LiquidLab project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just realized that I never added the final version of the fictitious juice company website I created for a graphic design class this spring. I never did find just the right pic online, so I’m leading with what might be the world’s first arm-only selfie (feat. beets!) to hold the place of a real photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I learn from this exercise? It’s hard to deal with all the content your “client” (or school project prompt) suggests you add in. The idea of this fake company is that they get people to subscribe to their custom juicing plans. The description in the prompt felt a bit confused on that tip - do busy people obsessed with their health want to read about farming practices, or receive so much hand holding before filling out the lifestyle choices/diet questionaire? Don’t they just want to speed ahead to the acai berries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found class projects challenging. Making up the rationale behind these imaginary people stretches your creative brain in the opposite way you need it to go for a real workplace scenario. In reality, the last thing you want to do is fill in a lot of blanks about what a customer wants. Truth is stranger than fiction, so you’d better try to figure out what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birds Of Prey!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/birdsofprey.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/birdsofprey.png&quot; alt=&quot;Birds of prey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for some design prompts online and found a decent collection at &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me&quot;&gt;Briefbox&lt;/a&gt;. The first prompt to catch my eye asked for an infographic on &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me/design-brief/birds-of-prey-infographic/&quot;&gt;“birds of prey”&lt;/a&gt;. The Briefbox people suggest looking at Wikipedia, which I did, only to be overwhelmed and bored by an academic account of phylogenic studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread paraphylies were observed in many phylogenetic studies. Unfortunately more recent and detailed studies are shown similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of Accipitriformes was well supported (e.g. relationship of Harpagus kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with Accipiter hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing Aquilinae and Harpiinae).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While science is totally of amazing, sometimes the way it’s presented on Wikipedia just makes one despair* of finding enough interesting, linear nuggets to make a little infographic story. So what did I do? Of course I just made some shit up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catipsum.com/&quot;&gt;Cat Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meowing non stop for food plan steps for world domination but lick arm hair. Find something else more interesting intently stare at the same spot lick butt, for hate dog poop on grasses, chase laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Yeah, but… not for long! I learned about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretarybird&quot;&gt;secretarybird&lt;/a&gt; from this article. Have you seen this thing??&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Layout Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/liquidlab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Liquid Lab Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid Lab saves your time, health and money. Or just the first two… maybe. Actually it does nothing. It’s a fake company. I’m only crafting a layout for its website because I’m taking a course on graphic design, and this was the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a decent stab at doing a simple layout, but it’s not that interesting. And it looks more like a poster than a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I wanted a simple white background, a well lit photo, bold sans serif text taking charge over the image. I thought that might feel like “you’re busy, you’re hip, you’re healthy - you want this juice”. However, I have yet to lay hands on such a photo- I’m going with what I find in the Creative Commons search (thanks and credit to Flickr user Stiftelsen Elektronikkbransjen for the photo!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would describe the sentiment behind this piece as: the vegetable pile is sort of like your chaotic life, and you’re glad to have someone else deal with it, blending it down into a sweet-ish, no-chew-required, food paste (“juicing”). I was just working with some phrasing like “Liquid Lab deals with these guys”, but I’m not entirely satisfied yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be sure to let you know what I come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Lot Of Tail</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GIFs are hilarious. It’s great to watch just the funniest part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://procatinator.com/images/tumblr_lkx04suye01qe1ucbo1_400.gif&quot;&gt;cat’s neurotic drive&lt;/a&gt; to bust through cardboard realized over and over again. Maybe they’re also sorta funny because that repetition is so unnatural. IDK. It would be great fun to really put my finger on exactly why a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ohmagif.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cute-rabbit-falling-asleep.gif&quot;&gt;bunny falling asleep at his work station&lt;/a&gt; is so hilarious, but I think that could also turn into a life’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, have you noticed there are a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeanniejeannie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_mkc10ltCHw1qj6juso1_500.gif&quot;&gt;subtle uses&lt;/a&gt; of animation out there? I love how it only takes a little movement on screen to captivate me, and the stiller it is the more peaceful I feel. It’s a bit like the old days when we just watched TV for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of sites seem to be using background video this way (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;AirBNB&lt;/a&gt;: “Ah, I will be so relaxed staying in that total stranger’s home!”). Subtlety has arrived in GIF-land as well. Last night I came across a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/kevintang/20-insanely-talented-gif-illustrators-you-should-follow?sub=3128308_2704994#.ba7wVOwAOQ&quot;&gt;roundup&lt;/a&gt; from BuzzFeed (!) of artists working with GIFs and decided, dangit, I want to try that, too. So this is where I got, just using layers in PhotoShop. If I do this again I think I will adhere to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabletopwhale.com/2014/11/03/how-to-make-an-animated-infographic.html&quot;&gt;Tabletop Whale’s&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. She seems like she knows what she’s doing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mapping Jobs Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jobmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a few basic heatmaps at work and wanted to take what I had learned and put it toward some “interesting” data. I thought it would be fun to do something with the 2012 Economic Census, so I went after some low hanging mapping fruit (gross) and put together &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; that displays either the “job births” or “job destructions” counted in each of our nation’s 280+ lovely MSAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my time so far has been spent on organizing the program to work efficiently. Since there are 8 survey years available (1977 to 2012), 280+ MSAs and something like 5 subcategories for each (depending on business size/age) preserving this dataset inside the program as something you can work with takes quite a bit of folding and unfolding. To understand d3’s nesting functions better I spent some quality time with Mr. Nester. (Pro-tip: you can actually paste your data into this site and work with nesting statements there. It’s a lot like using the console, but somehow easier.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I’m happy with: I used q.js to organize the flow of tasks through the program. I was able to borrow a lot of the structure from previous work projects, and doing it all over again brought a little solidity to the lesson. Getting the data once and then organizing and reorganizing it later adds a little speed - but nothing helped me more than realizing I had to pair down my dataset before I joined the data and started appending svgs (confession: in my first stab at this map, I had something like 12,000 DOM nodes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have at this point is a basic, functioning map. I’m looking forward to setting up a few more options. As mentioned, the data identifies companies by size and age. Since there’s always so much chatter about the importance of small businesses being “job creators”, I thought it would be interesting to see if any trends become evident on the map.
Making this map also made me think about how, in some ways, every heatmap/quantity map just becomes a map of the population. In this map, clearly New York and other large cities create and lose a ton of jobs. They also have a ton of people. I wonder whether adding a basic population heatmap as the base of the whole project would provide meaningful context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I haven’t done any real work on a layout. I’d like to do a little more research on the data and theories around it, and write some interesting intro-text. I could see this being one of 3-4 views on the data, all packed into one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this basic, functional map is just the beginning of a rich project!&lt;/p&gt;
