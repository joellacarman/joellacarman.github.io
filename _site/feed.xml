        <title>Covid confession icons</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
July 1, 2022
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBC Datagraphics team had published their fascinating callout to readers “Covid Confessions” long before I started. As the pandemic evolved, we felt that new categories of confession were becoming necessary. This meant I had the wonderful task of trying to emulate my predecessor’s style. Is it easy to tell which are different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newer/covid-confession-icons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Covid confession icons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that they are the last three may give it away, but these were my additions:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plan Your Vote</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
March 15, 2022
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an honor to work on the redesign of one of our team’s biggest initiatives for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus was on making each bit of voter logistics seamless and unambiguous. So instead of checks and x’s, which can actually be hard to maintain for the researchers and somewhat ambiguous for readers, we used a conversational writing style to (hopefully) follow the line of thought one might have when forming the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a simple page that thoughtfully provides critical information. It was promoted widely on the site, on television, and even in outdoor advertising and wound up receiving over TK visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the promotion was in-house. I crafted this background for automated Twitter graphics very quickly for automated graphics my colleague put together with Puppeteer, leveraging the type and color of the original piece.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mask effectiveness</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
January 17, 2022
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example of editing yourself, but still liking the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual graphic got more “likes” than any other in the history of @nbcnewsgraphics on Instagram (which is not a major account, the likes were ~90). I’m sure it was the suprising nature of the information shown more than the visual presentation, but that’s what graphics are all about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newer/mask-effectiveness.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The real graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you know, this is what I did not suggest using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/newer/mask-effectiveness-weird.png&quot; alt=&quot;The silly graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Housing first</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
July 15, 2021
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urban.org/features/housing-first-breaks-homelessness-jail-cycle&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/denver-hed-lg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustration features people whose lives were improved by an experimental housing program in Denver, CO, along with some of the items that help make their new apartments “home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge here was expressing that idea with an already heavily-used set of commissioned photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a fresh take, I worked with contrasts—of size, color, lightness, and balance. Anchoring the composition is a faded image of a downtown Denver street scene. Against that, a proud, crisp face shows the clarity and happiness that comes with having a place to be. These contrasts speak to the transformative power of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image received many accolades from the broader team and serves as a dynamic introduction to a summary of the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The unequal commute</title>

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you show not just how far potential workers are from jobs, but how difficult (and likely) it is for them to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quick turn feature highlights a new way to measure equity in transportation planning that considers just that issue: access to jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our challenge as the comms team was to make this complex measure easy to understand. A choropleth map is great for spatial data and worked well here to highlight the problem areas leaders should target with more funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also needed to make it easy for a reader to find a particular neighborhood on the map. The data is calculated by Census block group, not very intuitive for most people. Mapbox, with its built-in layer of roads and landmarks, was a great solution. Making that base layer visible through the data overlay required a lot of careful thought and experimentation with color, opacity, and layering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is a beautiful, textured map that’s easy to navigate and clearly identifies neighborhoods in need of additional transit.&lt;/p&gt;
