        <title>The unequal commute</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
October 6, 2020
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quick turn feature highlights a new way to measure equity in transportation planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers on this project worked with a very small areas, census block groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted readers to easily be able to find their neighborhood on the map, which can be difficult with a geographic boundary like this one which folks don’t really use in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming down to street level to see roads and landmarks is very handy for for orienting the reader without getting mired in technical definitions. Thanks to Mapbox, all of this functionality came built in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>School segregation</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
June 26, 2020
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious that a school is segregated when the student body is demographically homogenous, but Urban’s researchers point out the importance of considering a school’s surrounding demographics, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how this can be distilled into one number, our team created a scrollyteller that unpacks the index using a school that may not seem segregated at first, but, compared to the neighborhood it sits in, is actually quite segregated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers can also follow along in the explanatory section with a school of their own choosing, or find their school/school system in the lookup panel at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really dug into the report and notes for this project and became quite adept at explaining how it works (even according to the researchers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.urban.org/features/school-segregation-index/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/k12-illo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration serves to highlight that the data in the charts is about real kids who are connected, in ways good and bad, by the choices we make about resources across a system. It also gives readers something to look at during the considerably long page load :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trump at the G20</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
June 26, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the lead art for Kevin Liptak’s story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-g20-meetings/index.html&quot;&gt;Trump’s G20 orbits around Xi, Putin, and other world leaders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece follows an established style and I was able to turn it around in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/donald-trump-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-g20-meetings/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/trump-putin-xi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who qualified to debate</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
May 10, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many months as the 2020 race ramped up at CNN we made do with a set of mismatched photos rather than true head shots. The reporters I worked with liked using headshots in charts since it helps readers keep track of some of the lesser-known candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do what I could to polish those photos and make our graphics better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/09/politics/democratic-primary-debates-tracking-qualifications-polling-fundraising/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/debate-qualified.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Converting to black and white is a good trick for bringing unity to a ragged set. Dialing up the contrast and pairing with a strong blue also strengthened the cohesiveness. This new set was more eye-catching and the graphics that used them turned out to have pretty good legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colbert Show used a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/LateShow.jpg&quot;&gt;bar chart&lt;/a&gt; I made with the same set of heads on a July 2019 quarterly fund raising segment. The graphic above was included in an  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/13/how-to-qualify-for-a-presidential-debate-mh-orig.cnn&quot;&gt;explainer&lt;/a&gt; on the debates for CNN’s social channels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tax cuts and refunds</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
April 13, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic ran with the story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html&quot;&gt;Here’s who’s winning under Trump’s tax law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out by making bar chart so the individual states could be identified, but this buried the real takeaway: refunds shrank only in blue states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let go of individual state labels in favor of showing the red/blue grouping and it became a more concise and effective piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/tax-cuts.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fact, I learned the name for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320&quot;&gt;“beeswarm”&lt;/a&gt; charts. I wished I had learned it earlier because it would have been great here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DHS after the purge</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
April 17, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/politics/inside-dhs-after-the-purge/index.html&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; was captivated by this photo of a ribbon-cutting ceremony showing a number of soon-to-be-replaced officials and acting or otherwise temporary leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct notation is a handy (and cool) way to make it easy for a reader to see your point. Here it works well to note officials that are coming and going.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Age range of candidates</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
March 23, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This look at the generational spread of the Democratic field was inspired by Pete Buttigieg’s comment that his own youthful face was “the message” of his campaign. He told Morning Joe: “That’s why I often talk about how the world’s going to look in 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president. It’s to remind us that this isn’t just about one election.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what year will it be (or was it) when other candidates are 72, like Trump?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/23/politics/2020-presidential-race-generation-gap/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/pres-cand-age.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the charts I make at CNN use templates. It’s a sane way to handle daily graphics flow for many reasons, but one does enjoy a chance to get creative especially on a somewhat evergreen topic of candidate age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few days workshopping this chart with colleagues. The first feature to stay were the gray columns for generational bands. This is something I’ve seen Pew Research center do a number of times and makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to highlight the distance from age 72 for each candidate. It also creates a nice pattern. On mobile, however, I took this out since it’s not original information (it’s not hard to get that 37 is indeed a long way from 72).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN has since updated this same graphic and used it again in another piece to capture search interest in candidates’ age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Presidential vetoes</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
March 3, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it seems odd to think this would happen today, in the past many presidents have vetoed legislation from their own party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/02/politics/trump-presidents-veto-congress-history-override-national-emergency/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vetoes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scatterplot of presidential vetoes since 1789&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2020 Dems shift left</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
February 13, 2019
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry Enten crunched some fascinating numbers on political ideology and I captured them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/2020-democratic-field-more-liberal-than-past-years/index.html&quot;&gt;a graphic&lt;/a&gt;. Possibly my best piece of work for CNN so far is the donkey icon on this graph (though in hindsight I do wish I’d parted with the styleguide and chosen two blues with more contrast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/2020-democratic-field-more-liberal-than-past-years/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/enten-dem-cand-ideology.png&quot; alt=&quot;The average of 2020 frontrunners' ideological score according to VoteView.com is more liberal than past candidates'.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
