        <title>Rio de Janeiro &amp; Social Progress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It so happens that partners in Brazil completed a Social Progress Index for the administrative regions of Rio de Janeiro just months before the Olympics. Seizing on this opportunity to promote SPI’s work, our director flew to Rio and presented the index to journalists covering not the games, but the city around the games. I created this map to be handed out to reporters at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Redesigning SPI Scorecards (Again)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started working at this organization last year, I began to see this table &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/UnitedStates.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Old scorecard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Is my country within the one average absolute deviation from the median??&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost standard in every presentation and report, but it’s nearly impossible to read. I set out to make this legible and professional looking, and to pry it out of Excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my initial remake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/maps/social_progress&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/scorecard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of scorecard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Scorecards displayed on European Commission website for the Beta version of the EU Regional Social Progress Index. (Be thankful for UTF-8 encoding)&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-it-made-out-of&quot;&gt;What’s It Made Out Of?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the “visualization” piece of this project isn’t that sophisticated, I built these scorecards using D3. I found D3’s set of functions for stats-type math to be very handy, and D3 also provides a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macwright.org/2013/07/07/d3-for-html.html&quot;&gt;clean way to think about templating&lt;/a&gt;. It’s in a different universe from Excel speed-wise, but there is still a ton of math happening under the hood, which makes it a tidge slow to load, and also, vulnerable to crossbrowser weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-image-files&quot;&gt;Getting Image Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted, images of these scorecards are everywhere and the team needs to get image files easily. My original thought was to use SVG Crowbar to pry these out of the browser, so I set about making them out of pure SVG. Unfortunately, the images never came out with their CSS styling attached. Installing a Chrome extension to pry out images from a website is a bit of a big ask for most users anyway, so I abandoned this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for another way, I looked into using html canvas and libraries that convert these into image files. Perfect, I thought, not using HTML/CSS for text layout sucks anyway! I ripped everything up and started over with a much more semantic approach, and found happily that &lt;a href=&quot;http://cburgmer.github.io/rasterizeHTML.js/&quot;&gt;rasterizeHTML&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of converting the screen graphics, even going between retina and non-retina displays. My design also got lighter and better once I had some of my old friends like “border” and “div” back in town. Everybody wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example I downloaded from the browser as a .png:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/SA-scorecard.png&quot; alt=&quot;New scorecard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Redesigned redesign of SPI scorecards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I began working on these, a number of coworkers have gotten interested in using R for their work, so I’ve eliminated the calculations in JavaScript and have instead been working to port the code for generating strength/weaknesses values to R. Now a very large datasheet feeds the web app a straight value for the color of each dot. To avoid using the web all together, I’ve also created an InDesign template and used data merge to create the full set of cards. The resulting images are much sharper (rasterizeHTML does a good job, but it’s not a pro designer tool), and the technology used to make them is understood by others on my team. In the end, I think this is a more flexible and smart arrangement, especially because the new site design doesn’t include a natural home for these webified scorecards anyway. :(&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work Projects From 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are a few notable projects from my year. Notable, at least, to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renewoureconomy.org/voterinteractive/&quot;&gt;first interactive&lt;/a&gt; I worked on as an actual professional being paid cash money. I was the main developer on the project, with a lot of guidance from my excellent colleague, Reed Spool, for which I will always be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renewoureconomy.org/voterinteractive/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/elexmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lot better at d3 and JavaScript after this project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the year I started working at the Social Progress Imperative. My title here is “graphic designer”, so I made myself a business card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/bizcards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Biz card&quot; /&gt;
(And I made new ones for everyone else at the company.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more exciting than the business cards, I created slides for our director’s second &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_green_how_we_can_make_the_world_a_better_place_by_2030?language=en&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; given in London last September at TED Global. The scatterplot is a perennial at SPI, since our mission is to advance this index as a measure of things left out of GDP, notably the things that actually make life better. The fact that some countries are so far over or under the curve demonstrates that GDP doesn’t automatically convert to what we describe as “social progress”, as measured by “indicators” like “water and sanitation”, “access to basic knowledge”, “nutrition and basic medical care”, “personal rights”, etc for a whole society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/TED-slide.png&quot; alt=&quot;TED slides&quot; /&gt;
I focused on making these legible from far away in a dark room: dark background, strong contrast, minimal markings on the charts. Reportedly (via Michael Green) these received compliments from the TED Global people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got married and went absolutely nuts creating the main image for our wedding website (excerpted here). This strange obsession taught me a lot about Illustrator and the importance of having some kind of color palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/town2-01.svg&quot; alt=&quot;The view from town&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did a few other things for my job, like an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/blog/posts/do-smoking-habits-change-with-social-progress&quot;&gt;interactive scatterplot&lt;/a&gt;, layout for print products, HTML emails (gasp!) and these little quickie ads for Twitter (design and copy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/socprogress/status/671728387984109568&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/access-basic-know.png&quot; alt=&quot;#givingtuesday ads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, InDesign accomplishment of the year: figuring out how to run Arabic text (right-to-left) in the same line with English numbers (left-to-right) for these translated versions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/socprogress/status/680359982076944384&quot;&gt;People’s Report Card&lt;/a&gt;, a collaborative project with Global Citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not pictured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also during my stint at Graphicacy, I worked on their annual Death &amp;amp; Taxes poster, a visualization of the federal budget. It’s a lot of circles. Reed and I began work on a project to create the poster in JavaScript instead of R, reasoning that a web browser is a good place for graphics, and we could get closer to the final (bringing in images, for example) before pulling everything into Illustrator with SVG Crowbar for the actual print poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a pretty sweet circle generator that pumped out one branch of goverment at a time in a ring of circles. We also created some fun layout tools that would allow a designer to adjust the radius of the outer ring and spacing among subdepartments on it before exporting into the layout. It’s a bit hard to explain, better to show, but the project isn’t online. I did learn that trigonometry is kind of fascinating (if you’ve forgotten how it works, read about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://processing.org/tutorials/trig/&quot;&gt;“unit circle”&lt;/a&gt; - triangles control the circle!). The math makes a lot more sense when you’re using it to actually accomplish something than it did when you were a pimply pre-teen just freaking out that Mr. Bergzolf would catch you chewing gum or give you a D. SOH-CAH-TOA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t have the work to show for that, here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphicacy.com/can-raw-data-be-cooked/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about my best guess for explaining negative numbers in the federal budget. I was particularly proud of my little bar graph. What great colors! I think it really has the look of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://graphicacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/crimevictimsfund.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bar graph from blog post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birds Of Prey!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/birdsofprey.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/birdsofprey.png&quot; alt=&quot;Birds of prey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for some design prompts online and found a decent collection at &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me&quot;&gt;Briefbox&lt;/a&gt;. The first prompt to catch my eye asked for an infographic on &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me/design-brief/birds-of-prey-infographic/&quot;&gt;“birds of prey”&lt;/a&gt;. The Briefbox people suggest looking at Wikipedia, which I did, only to be overwhelmed and bored by an academic account of phylogenic studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread paraphylies were observed in many phylogenetic studies. Unfortunately more recent and detailed studies are shown similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of Accipitriformes was well supported (e.g. relationship of Harpagus kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with Accipiter hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing Aquilinae and Harpiinae).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While science is totally of amazing, sometimes the way it’s presented on Wikipedia just makes one despair* of finding enough interesting, linear nuggets to make a little infographic story. So what did I do? I made some shit up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catipsum.com/&quot;&gt;Cat Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meowing non stop for food plan steps for world domination but lick arm hair. Find something else more interesting intently stare at the same spot lick butt, for hate dog poop on grasses, chase laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Yeah, but… not for long! I learned about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretarybird&quot;&gt;secretarybird&lt;/a&gt; from this article. Have you seen this thing??&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mapping Jobs Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jobmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a few basic heatmaps at work and wanted to take what I had learned and put it toward some “interesting” data. I thought it would be fun to do something with the 2012 Economic Census, so I went after some low hanging mapping fruit (gross) and put together &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; that displays either the “job births” or “job destructions” counted in each of our nation’s 280+ lovely MSAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my time so far has been spent on organizing the program to work efficiently. Since there are 8 survey years available (1977 to 2012), 280+ MSAs and something like 5 subcategories for each (depending on business size/age) preserving this dataset inside the program as something you can work with takes quite a bit of folding and unfolding. To understand d3’s nesting functions better I spent some quality time with Mr. Nester. (Pro-tip: you can actually paste your data into this site and work with nesting statements there. It’s a lot like using the console, but somehow easier.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I’m happy with: I used q.js to organize the flow of tasks through the program. I was able to borrow a lot of the structure from previous work projects, and doing it all over again brought a little solidity to the lesson. Getting the data once and then organizing and reorganizing it later adds a little speed - but nothing helped me more than realizing I had to pair down my dataset before I joined the data and started appending svgs (confession: in my first stab at this map, I had something like 12,000 DOM nodes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have at this point is a basic, functioning map. I’m looking forward to setting up a few more options. As mentioned, the data identifies companies by size and age. Since there’s always so much chatter about the importance of small businesses being “job creators”, I thought it would be interesting to see if any trends become evident on the map.
Making this map also made me think about how, in some ways, every heatmap/quantity map just becomes a map of the population. In this map, clearly New York and other large cities create and lose a ton of jobs. They also have a ton of people. I wonder whether adding a basic population heatmap as the base of the whole project would provide meaningful context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I haven’t done any real work on a layout. I’d like to do a little more research on the data and theories around it, and write some interesting intro-text. I could see this being one of 3-4 views on the data, all packed into one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this basic, functional map is just the beginning of a rich project!&lt;/p&gt;
