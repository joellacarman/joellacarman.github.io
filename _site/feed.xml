        <title>Birds Of Prey!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/birdsofprey.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/birdsofprey.png&quot; alt=&quot;Birds of prey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for some design prompts online and found a decent collection at &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me&quot;&gt;Briefbox&lt;/a&gt;. The first prompt to catch my eye asked for an infographic on &lt;a href=&quot;http://briefbox.me/design-brief/birds-of-prey-infographic/&quot;&gt;“birds of prey”&lt;/a&gt;. The Briefbox people suggest looking at Wikipedia, which I did, only to be overwhelmed and bored by an academic account of phylogenic studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread paraphylies were observed in many phylogenetic studies. Unfortunately more recent and detailed studies are shown similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of Accipitriformes was well supported (e.g. relationship of Harpagus kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with Accipiter hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing Aquilinae and Harpiinae).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While science is totally of amazing, sometimes the way it’s presented on Wikipedia just makes one despair* of finding enough interesting, linear nuggets to make a little infographic story. So what did I do? Of course I just made some shit up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catipsum.com/&quot;&gt;Cat Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meowing non stop for food plan steps for world domination but lick arm hair. Find something else more interesting intently stare at the same spot lick butt, for hate dog poop on grasses, chase laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Yeah, but… not for long! I learned about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretarybird&quot;&gt;secretarybird&lt;/a&gt; from this article. Have you seen this thing??&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Layout Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/liquidlab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Liquid Lab Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid Lab saves your time, health and money. Or just the first two… maybe. Actually it does nothing. It’s a fake company. I’m only crafting a layout for its website because I’m taking a course on graphic design, and this was the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a decent stab at doing a simple layout, but it’s not that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I wanted a simple white background, a well lit photo of delicious juice and some very large, bold sans serif text taking charge over the image. I thought that might feel like “you’re busy, you’re hip, you’re healthy - you want this juice”. However, I don’t get to commission a photo, and am going with what I find in the Creative Commons search (thanks and credit to Flickr user Stiftelsen Elektronikkbransjen for the photo!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea now is that the vegetable pile is sort of like your chaotic life, and you’re glad to have someone else deal with it, blending it down into a sweet-ish, no-chew-required, food paste (“juicing”). I was just working with some phrasing like “Liquid Lab deals with these guys”, but I’m not entirely satisfied yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be sure to let you know what I come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Lot Of Tail</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GIFs are hilarious. It’s great to watch just the funniest part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://procatinator.com/images/tumblr_lkx04suye01qe1ucbo1_400.gif&quot;&gt;cat’s neurotic drive&lt;/a&gt; to bust through cardboard realized over and over again. Maybe they’re also sorta funny because that repetition is so unnatural. IDK. It would be great fun to really put my finger on exactly why a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ohmagif.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cute-rabbit-falling-asleep.gif&quot;&gt;bunny falling asleep at his work station&lt;/a&gt; is so hilarious, but I think that could also turn into a life’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, have you noticed there are a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeanniejeannie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_mkc10ltCHw1qj6juso1_500.gif&quot;&gt;subtle uses&lt;/a&gt; of animation out there? I love how it only takes a little movement on screen to captivate me, and the stiller it is the more peaceful I feel. It’s a bit like the old days when we just watched TV for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of sites seem to be using background video this way (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;AirBNB&lt;/a&gt;: “Ah, I will be so relaxed staying in that total stranger’s home!”). Subtlety has arrived in GIF-land as well. Last night I came across a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/kevintang/20-insanely-talented-gif-illustrators-you-should-follow?sub=3128308_2704994#.ba7wVOwAOQ&quot;&gt;roundup&lt;/a&gt; from BuzzFeed (!) of artists working with GIFs and decided, dangit, I want to try that, too. So this is where I got, just using layers in PhotoShop. If I do this again I think I will adhere to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabletopwhale.com/2014/11/03/how-to-make-an-animated-infographic.html&quot;&gt;Tabletop Whale’s&lt;/a&gt; tutorial. She seems like she knows what she’s doing!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cantstop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Can&#39;t stop won&#39;t stop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wonderful man, Sean, my fiancee, got me a drawing tablet for my birthday last year. I’m ashamed to say it’s taken me a while to get into using it. But scooting yourself into that creative groove you need for drawing can be a lot of work. Especially when you’re trying to figure out new tools. Excuses! But really, I’m gonna use this thing more. I’m gonna improve the drawings on this site – and maybe animate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t stop, won’t stop!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mapping Jobs Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/jobmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a few basic heatmaps at work and wanted to take what I had learned and put it toward some “interesting” data. I thought it would be fun to do something with the 2012 Economic Census, so I went after some low hanging mapping fruit (gross) and put together &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/census/index.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; that displays either the “job births” or “job destructions” counted in each of our nation’s 280+ lovely MSAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my time so far has been spent on organizing the program to work efficiently. Since there are 8 survey years available (1977 to 2012), 280+ MSAs and something like 5 subcategories for each (depending on business size/age) preserving this dataset inside the program as something you can work with takes quite a bit of folding and unfolding. To understand d3’s nesting functions better I spent some quality time with Mr. Nester. (Pro-tip: you can actually paste your data into this site and work with nesting statements there. It’s a lot like using the console, but somehow easier.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I’m happy with: I used q.js to organize the flow of tasks through the program. I was able to borrow a lot of the structure from previous work projects, and doing it all over again brought a little solidity to the lesson. Getting the data once and then organizing and reorganizing it later adds a little speed - but nothing helped me more than realizing I had to pair down my dataset before I joined the data and started appending svgs (confession: in my first stab at this map, I had something like 12,000 DOM nodes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have at this point is a basic, functioning map. I’m looking forward to setting up a few more options. As mentioned, the data identifies companies by size and age. Since there’s always so much chatter about the importance of small businesses being “job creators”, I thought it would be interesting to see if any trends become evident on the map.
Making this map also made me think about how, in some ways, every heatmap/quantity map just becomes a map of the population. In this map, clearly New York and other large cities create and lose a ton of jobs. They also have a ton of people. I wonder whether adding a basic population heatmap as the base of the whole project would provide meaningful context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I haven’t done any real work on a layout. I’d like to do a little more research on the data and theories around it, and write some interesting intro-text. I could see this being one of 3-4 views on the data, all packed into one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this basic, functional map is just the beginning of a rich project!&lt;/p&gt;
