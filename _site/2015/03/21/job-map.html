<p>I’ve done a few basic heatmaps at work and wanted to take what I had learned and put it toward some “interesting” data. I thought it would be fun to do something with the 2012 Economic Census, so I went after some low hanging mapping fruit (gross) and put together <a href="/projects/census/index.html">this piece</a> that displays either the “job births” or “job destructions” counted in each of our nation’s 280+ lovely MSAs.</p>

<p>Most of my time so far has been spent on organizing the program to work efficiently. Since there are 8 survey years available (1977 to 2012), 280+ MSAs and something like 5 subcategories for each (depending on business size/age) preserving this dataset inside the program as something you can work with takes quite a bit of folding and unfolding. To understand d3’s nesting functions better I spent some quality time with Mr. Nester. (Pro-tip: you can actually paste your data into this site and work with nesting statements there. It’s a lot like using the console, but somehow easier.)</p>

<p>Other things I’m happy with: I used q.js to organize the flow of tasks through the program. I was able to borrow a lot of the structure from previous work projects, and doing it all over again brought a little solidity to the lesson. Getting the data once and then organizing and reorganizing it later adds a little speed - but nothing helped me more than realizing I had to pair down my dataset before I joined the data and started appending svgs (confession: in my first stab at this map, I had something like 12,000 DOM nodes).</p>

<p>What I have at this point is a basic, functioning map. I’m looking forward to setting up a few more options. As mentioned, the data identifies companies by size and age. Since there’s always so much chatter about the importance of small businesses being “job creators”, I thought it would be interesting to see if any trends become evident on the map.
Making this map also made me think about how, in some ways, every heatmap/quantity map just becomes a map of the population. In this map, clearly New York and other large cities create and lose a ton of jobs. They also have a ton of people. I wonder whether adding a basic population heatmap as the base of the whole project would provide meaningful context.</p>

<p>Finally, I haven’t done any real work on a layout. I’d like to do a little more research on the data and theories around it, and write some interesting intro-text. I could see this being one of 3-4 views on the data, all packed into one page.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that this basic, functional map is just the beginning of a rich project!</p>
