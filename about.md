Hello!

I'm an interactive designer/developer living in Washington, D.C. In a previous life I worked as a news researcher, where I learned to love all things esoteric and number-related. I took some time out to learn development skills and now I bring numbers and design together into compelling visuals for an economics-themed think tank. 

I enjoy spending time with my family, working on my old house and wishing I had a dog.
