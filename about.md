Hello!

I'm a former news researcher and lover of all things esoteric and number-related. Nowadays I'm employed as an "information graphic designer/developer" and trying desperately to get better at both. See how I do by watching this blog.

Not into thinking complete thoughts? Me either! Find me on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/jestraley)

Current feed blend is:

 * 1/3 dogs
 * 1/3 news-of-the-weird/jokes
 * 1/3 dealer's choice, to include RTs from Alberto Cairo, art and, occasionally, news
