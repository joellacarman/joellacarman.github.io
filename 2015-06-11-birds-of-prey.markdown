I was looking around for some design prompts online and found a decent collection at [Briefbox](http://briefbox.me). The first prompt to catch my eye asked for an infographic on ["birds of prey"](http://briefbox.me/design-brief/birds-of-prey-infographic/). They suggest looking at Wikipedia, which I did, only to be overwhelmed and bored by an academic account of phylogenic studies. Blah. So instead of being informative, I eventually opted for some good old crass humor. But hey, I could have just put Lorem, Hipster or Cat Ipsum in there! "Favor packaging over toy."
