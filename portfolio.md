<p class="portfolio-writeup">
    I created this one-page infographic in response to a design brief found online. Obviously, this one is just for fun but I would love to create serious work like this.<br />

<img src="/assets/portfolio/design-principles.jpg" alt="Slide showing design principles of Social Progress Index">
<p class="portfolio-writeup">
    I redesigned the slide template for Social Progress Imperative, including several custom graphics like this. Each rectangle could also be used on Twitter to promote the principles that make the index unique.<br />

<p class="portfolio-writeup">
    I redesigned SPI's country "scorecards" to be more legible, easier to edit, more flexible with datasets and more easily distributed to external partners. I used d3 to "template" and html2canvas to allow <a href="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/scorecards-2016/index.html">downloading</a> as PNG file. An earlier version of this project can be found on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/maps/social_progress">European Commission website</a>.<br />
