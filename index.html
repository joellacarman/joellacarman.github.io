              <p>I'm a creative developer with a background in news. I changed direction in my career because I got jealous of all the fun developers were having building the final package.</p>
              <p>My skills now include Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, Backbone and PostgreSQL.</p>
              <p>I believe strongly that any creative project should be driven by concern for clarity and substance, and I aspire to apply this to my code as much as my written work.</p>

              <p>Until recently I worked as a librarian at NPR. Together with editorial staff, I gathered the various facts, data and multimedia tidbits that go into crafting a rich story experience.</p>
              <p>I contributed to a variety of editorial projects, including things like @todayin1963 and Pop-Up Politics, and a few <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/08/28/216410432/what-do-we-forget-when-we-remember-history">original</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/02/10/267561895/it-took-a-eugenicist-to-come-up-with-moron">works</a> of my <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112651608">own</a>.</p>
              <p>I love the storytelling potential of structured data. Because I'm a DIY person by nature, I set out to learn to code. I've just finished a 12-week intensive course with <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">General Assembly</a> to learn full-stack web development.</p>
              <p>Now I am looking for the perfect opportunity to put these skills to use, coding rich experiences that engage audiences through a sense of personal relevance and delight.</p>

                <p>"Who Said That?" is a trivia game where players guess which member of Congress issued a Tweet drawn at random from the Twitter API. It is the first project I completed at GA WDI (General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a>).</p>
                <p>I built this app with Ruby on Rails in a 5 day sprint. It features a hand-made user authentication (a requirement for the assignment), and tracks player scores on a leaderboard.</p> <a href="https://github.com/joellastraley/whosaidthat">GitHub</a> <a href="http://secret-harbor-5485.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>

                <p>"Partify" allows you to crowd-source the playlist for your next gathering, drawing from the Spotify and YouTube APIs. It was developed as a 5 day group project during WDI, and is also built on Rails.</p>
                <p>I liked this project because it solves a real-world problem, and I got to focus on designing and building the front end. Future plans include improving the mobile experience, especially on the homepage. We agreed this would be a great candidate for Backbone, to give the code better structure and have smooth one page functionality.</p> <a href="https://github.com/stephenstanwood/party-playr">GitHub</a> <a href="http://pplayr.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>

                <p>"PT Helper" is designed to help physical therapy patients keep track of their assigned exercises and progress during therapy.</p>
                <p>I built this Backbone app with from-scratch user authentication during a 5 day sprint. In the next cycle of development, I plan to create a timer function that will lead patients through their PT routine and record completed exercises in a database. I also plan to add photo-upload functionality, so that patients can add images or video of their therapist demonstrating exercises.</p>
