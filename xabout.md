I’m a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. I work with the team at CNN Politics. I specialize in charts and graphs, but have also been known to do layout, print work and occasional copy writing.

Previously I worked as a librarian at NPR. I love to find out *why* and *how*, and to spot things that don’t quite add up.

My goal is to bring these various talents together to tell important stories. If you think I could help with yours, please reach out: jstraley@gmail.com.
