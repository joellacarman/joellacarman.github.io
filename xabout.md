I'm a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. I work with the team at the National League of Cities.  

Previously I worked as a news librarian at NPR where I learned the fine art of digging and a love for all things esoteric and number-related. 

I've spent the years since NPR learning how to bring visual structures to stories, create graphics that engage, and develop data visualizations that function well across devices.

Thanks for looking at my work, DM me on Twitter if you'd like: @jestraley.
