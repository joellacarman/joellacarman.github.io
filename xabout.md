I’m a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. I work with the team at the National League of Cities making data visualizations, interactive work (I also code), assorted web graphics, print work and copywriting for marketing pieces. 

Previously I worked as a librarian at NPR. I’ve retained a healthy need to dig from my time in the newsroom. I can be counted on to find out *why*, and to spot things that don’t quite add up. 

My goal is to bring these various talents together to tell important stories. If you think I could help with yours, reach out: jstraley@gmail.com.
