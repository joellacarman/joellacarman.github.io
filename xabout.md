Hello!

I'm a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. and I work with the team at the National League of Cities. 

In a previous life I worked as a news researcher, where I learned to love all things esoteric and number-related. I've since followed my calling to do design work and built that initial interest in data and spreadsheet mechanics into web development skills, thanks in part to a coding bootcamp.

Thanks for looking at my work.
