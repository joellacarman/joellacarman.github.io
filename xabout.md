I'm a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. I work with the team at the National League of Cities. I strive to make things that make sense and are cool.  

Previously I worked as a news librarian at NPR, where I learned to love all things esoteric and number-related. I've since followed my calling to do design work and built that initial interest in data and spreadsheet mechanics into web development skills. I'm still trying to work out [my interesting career path](/assets/career-path@2x.png).

Thanks for looking at my work, DM if you'd like: @jestraley.
