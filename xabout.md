I'm a graphic designer in Washington, D.C. I work with the team at the National League of Cities. 

Previously I worked as a news librarian at NPR, where I learned to love all things esoteric and number-related. I've since followed my calling to do design work and built that initial interest in data and spreadsheet mechanics into web development skills, thanks in part to a coding bootcamp.

I strive to make things that make sense and are cool. Thanks for looking at my work, and feel free to get in touch: @jestraley.
