Hello!

I'm an interactive designer/developer living in Washington, D.C. In a previous life I worked as a news researcher, where I learned to love all things esoteric and number-related. I took some time out to learn development skills and now I bring numbers and design together into compelling visuals for an economics-themed think tank. Find my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/StraleyResume.pdf).

I enjoy listening to [college radio](http://www.radiok.org/) with my husband, working on my old house and wishing I had a dog.
